This little project demonstrates a "poor man's" way of simulating AXI cycles.

The ip creator tool is used to generate an AXI bus master and save it into an ip repository. 
Then a super simple testbench is used to start the master running.  The bus master HDL can be 
modified to create the desired AXI traffic.
